This repository contains a collection of labs from the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence module, completed during my third year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

### Lab Summaries

**Lab 1: Introduction to Prolog**  
- Installed SWI Prolog and worked through basic concepts using sample knowledge bases.  
- Completed introductory exercises to familiarize with Prolog syntax and queries.

**Lab 2: Python, NumPy & Prolog**  
- Explored arrays and vectors in Python using NumPy within a Jupyter Notebook.  
- Focused on matrix operations and understanding vector differences.  
- Introduced Prolog concepts such as unification and proof through practical exercises.

**Lab 3: Perceptron in Python & Prolog Recursion**  
- Implemented a perceptron as a decision maker using Python, working through tasks in a Jupyter Notebook.  
- Solved the Monkey and Banana Problem in Prolog, focusing on state representation and recursion.

**Lab 4: Python Matrix Operations & Prolog State Transitions**  
- Demonstrated matrix multiplication in Python and extended the perceptron work from Lab 3.  
- Enhanced the Monkey & Banana Prolog solution by adding state transitions for the monkey to eat the banana.

**Lab 5: Media Advisor Expert System & Perceptron Training**  
- Extended the Media Advisor expert system in Prolog by adding additional rules and knowledge representation.  
- Applied perceptron training formulas to simulate logical gates (AND, OR, XOR) using a spreadsheet model.
