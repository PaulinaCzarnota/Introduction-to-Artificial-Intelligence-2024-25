This repository contains a collection of labs from my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence module, completed during my third year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

**Lab 1**  
*Introduction to Prolog*:  
Installed SWI Prolog and explored the basics using sample knowledge bases. Attempted introductory Prolog exercises.

**Lab 2**  
*Python and NumPy*:  
Worked on tasks and exercises involving arrays and vectors in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. Focused on understanding matrices, vectors, and their differences in NumPy.

*Prolog, Unification and Proof*:  
Explored unification and proof concepts in Prolog and completed practical exercises.

**Lab 3**  
*Python*:  
Implemented a perceptron as a decision maker in Python, working through exercises in a Jupyter Notebook.

*Prolog*:  
Solved the Monkey and Banana Problem, focusing on state representation and transitions. Explored recursion through practical examples and completed related exercises.

**Lab 4**  
*Python*:  
Worked on matrix multiplication exercises and demonstrated the perceptron tasks from Lab 3.

*Prolog*:  
Extended the Monkey & Banana problem by adding state-changing clauses for the monkey to eat the banana.

**Lab 5**  
*Prolog*:  
Extended the Media Advisor expert system by adding new rules and knowledge to semantic networks. Added perceptron training formulas for emulating logical gates like AND, OR, and XOR in a spreadsheet.
